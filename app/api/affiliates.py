"""The affiliate registry, over HTTP.

Every write here goes through the Phase 3 services, which is where the real
rules live - overlapping periods refused by the database, codes upper-cased,
money never floats. This layer's job is permission checks, readable errors,
and committing.

**Section 6.5: a model may never edit anything determining what they are
owed.** The `affiliate` role holds no permissions at all (app/core/permissions
.py), so every route below refuses it. That is not asserted here - it is
proven per endpoint in tests/test_affiliates_api.py, because "enforced
server-side" is a claim that needs a failing request to back it up.

**`compensation.manage` is a distinct permission from `affiliates.manage`,
used only on the compensation route.** Adding a code is administrative;
changing a rate is money, and the two must be gateable separately even where
today's roles happen to grant both together (ADR 0018).
